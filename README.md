My take on the Trexquant Hangman Challenge using Transformer-based MLM combined with statistical heuristic approach.
<br/>
Development of an intelligent Hangman solver that uses Transformer-based Masked Language Models (MLMs) combined with heuristic strategies. The approach aims to improve the accuracy of letter prediction by integrating deep learning models with statistical heuristics. The initial training achieved a win rate of approximately 60%, which slightly decreased to 56.8% during  the final execution due to some silly weight adjustments. Despite computationalconstraints, the strategy shows promising potential for further improvement with more robust models.
